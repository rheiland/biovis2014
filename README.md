Scripts, etc, for our BioVis2014 data contest entry. 
Rf. http://www.biovis.net/year/2014/info/contest_data

The file match.txt contains our submission for matching 30 "unknown" networks to 18 "known" networks.

Quick start:
. create a main working director, e.g. biovis
. create 4 subdirs under that: 
    anatomy, example_networks, contest_networks, test_networks
. download/unzip the contest data files to the relevant subdirs
. download the scripts and additional data file(s) from this repo into the relevant subdirs (rf. tutorial.pdf)
