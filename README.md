==========

Scripts, etc, for our BioVis2014 data contest entry. 
Rf. http://www.biovis.net/year/2014/info/contest_data

The file match.txt contains our submission for matching 30 "unknown" networks to 18 "known" networks.

One of the goals of our entry is to demonstrate that Python is an easy to use language/environment for
performing brain network analysis and to encourage students to experiment with Python if they have not yet.

### Quick start:
* create a main working director, e.g. biovis
* create 4 subdirs under that: 
    anatomy, example_networks, contest_networks, test_networks
* download/unzip the contest data files to the relevant subdirs
* download the scripts and additional data file(s) from this repo into the relevant subdirs (rf. tutorial.pdf)
